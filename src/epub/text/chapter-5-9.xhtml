			<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:title">IX: IN WHAT MANNER THE PAINS OF CHILD-BIRTH CAME UPON HIM, AND HOW HE BECAME A WIDOWER</h3>


<p class="continue">Not long after this I did take my godfather with me, and ride into the
Spessart to get certain news and certificate of my descent and noble
birth; which I gat without difficulty from the book of baptisms and my
godfather's witness: and presently thereafter visited the priest that
had dwelt at Hanau and had taken care of me: which gave me a writing to
declare where my late father had died, and that I had abode with him to
his death and thereafter for a long time with Master Ramsay, the
commandant at Hanau, under the name of Simplicissimus: yea, I had an
instrument containing my whole history drawn up by a notary out of the
mouth of witnesses; for I thought, "Who knoweth when thou wilt have
need of it?" And this journey did cost me 400 thalers, for on my return
I was captured by a party, dismounted, and plundered so that I and my
dad or godfather came off naked and hardly with our lives.</p>

<p>Meanwhile things went ill at home: for as soon as my wife knew her
husband was a nobleman she not only did play the great lady, but did
neglect all housekeeping; which I bore in silence because she was big
with child: moreover, misfortune came on my cattle and robbed me of my
chiefest and best: all which 'twould have been possible to endure, but
O Gemini! misfortunes came not singly: for even then while my wife was
delivered, the maid was brought to bed likewise: and the child she bore
was indeed like to me, but that which my wife had was so like to the
farm-servant as it had been cut on the pattern of his face. Nay, more!
for the lady of whom I writ above did in the same night cause one to be
laid at my door with notice in writing that I was the father: and so
did I get a family of three at once, and could not but expect that
others would creep out of every corner, which caused me not a few grey
hairs. But so will it fare with whoever doth follow his own bestial
lusts in such a godless and wicked way of life as I had led.</p>

<p>And now what to do! I must have the baptism and be soundly punished by
the magistrate: and the government being then Swedish, and I an old
soldier of the emperor, the score was the heavier to pay: all which was
but the preface to my complete ruination the second time. And although
all these manifold disasters did greatly trouble me, yet my wife
contrariwise took all lightly; yea, did mock at me day and night about
the fine treasure that had been laid at my door and for which I had
paid so dearly: yet had she but known how 'twas with me and the maid
she would have plagued me yet worse: but that good creature was so
complacent as to let herself be persuaded with as much money as I
should other ways have been fined for her sake, to swear her child to a
fop that had at times visited me the year before and had been at the
wedding, but whom otherwise she knew not. Yet must she go a-packing,
for my wife did suspect what I thought of her and the farm-servant, yet
dared not hint thereat: for else had I proved to her that I could not
at once be with her and with the maid. Yet all the while I was
tormented with the thought that I must rear a child for my servant, and
mine own sons should not be my heirs, and yet must I hold my peace and
be glad that none else knew of it: and with such thoughts did I daily
torment myself, while my wife revelled every hour in wine; for since
our marriage she had so used herself to the bottle that 'twas seldom
away from her mouth, and she herself scarce went to bed any night but
half-drunk: by which means she robbed her child of its nourishment and
so inflamed her inward parts that soon after they fell out, and so made
me a widower the second time, which went so my heart that I wellnigh
laughed myself into a sickness.</p>
