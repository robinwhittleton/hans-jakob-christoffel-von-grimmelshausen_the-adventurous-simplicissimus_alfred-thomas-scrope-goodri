<p class="continue">Now this desire to visit the Mummelsee increased with me when I learned
from my foster-father that he had been there and knew the way thither;
but when he heard that I likewise would go, "And what will ye gain,"
says he, "by going thither? My son with his old dad will see naught
else but the picture of a pond lying in the midst of a great wood, and
when he hath paid for his present taste with sore distaste, he will
have naught but repentance and weary feet (for a man can hardly come to
the place by riding) and the way back instead of the way thither. Nor
should ever any man have had me to go thither had I not been forced to
flee there when Doctor Daniel (by which he meant Duc d'Anguin<a href="#div2Ref_41" id="div2_41" class="pginternal"><sup>[41]</sup></a>)
marched with his troops down through the country to Philippsburg." Yet
my curiosity would not be turned aside by his dissuasion, but I got me
a fellow that should guide me thither; so my father, seeing my fixed
intent, said, since the oat-crop was gathered in, and there was neither
hoeing nor reaping to be done on the farm, he would even go with me and
shew the way. For he loved me so that he would fain not let me out of
his sight, and since all the people of the country believed I was his
true-born son, he was proud of me; and so behaved to me and to all
others as a poor man might well do in respect of a son whom good
fortune, without his own help and assistance, had turned into a fine
gentleman.</p>

<p>So together we set off over hill and dale and came to the Mummelsee;
and that before we had gone six hours, for my dad was as lively as a
cricket and as good a traveller as any young man. And there we consumed
what meat and drink we had brought with us, for the long journey and
the high mountain on which the lake lieth had made us both hungry and
thirsty. So having refreshed ourselves I did inspect the lake, and
found lying in it certain hewn timbers which my dad and I took to be
the remains of the Würtemberg raft: and I by geometry took or estimated
the length and breadth of the water (for 'twas far too wearisome to go
round the lake and measure it by paces or feet), and entered the
dimensions, by means of the scale of reduction, in my tablets. And
having done this, the sky being completely clear and the air windless
and calm, I must needs try what truth was in the legend that a storm
would arise if any should throw a stone into the lake; having already
found those stories I had heard, how the lake would suffer no trout to
live in it, to be true, by reason of the mineral taste of the waters.
So to make trial of this, I walked along the lake to the left, where
the water, which elsewhere is as clear as a crystal, doth begin, by
reason of the monstrous depth, to shew as black as coal, and therefore
is so dreadful of appearance that the mere look of it doth terrify.
And there I began to cast in stones as great as I could carry; my
foster-father or dad not only refusing to help me, but warning and
begging me to give over, as much as in him lay: but I went busily on
with my work, and such stones as by reason of their size and weight I
could not carry, I rolled down till I had cast more than thirty such
into the lake. Then began the sky to be covered with black clouds, in
which terrible thundering was heard, so that my dad, which stood on the
other side of the lake by the outlet, lamenting over my work, cried out
to me that I should escape, lest we be caught by the rain and the
dreadful storm, or even a worse mishap chance to us. But in despite of
all I answered him, "Father, I will stay and await the end even though
it rained pitchforks." "Yea, yea," answered he, "ye act like all madcap
boys, that care not if the world perish."</p>

<p>But I, while I listened to his scolding, turned not mine eyes away from
the depths of the lake, expecting to see certain bladders or bubbles
rising up from the bottom, as is wont to happen when stones are thrown
into deep water whether still or running. Yet saw I naught of the kind,
but was ware of certain creatures floating far down in the depths,
which in form reminded me of frogs, and flitted about like sparks from
a mounting rocket which in the air doth work its full effect: and as
they came nearer and nearer to me they seemed to grow larger and more
like to the human form: at which at first great wonder took hold of me,
and at last, when I saw them hard by me, a great fear and trembling.
"Ah," said I then to myself in my terror and wonder, and yet so loud
that my dad, that stood beyond the lake, could hear me, though the
noise of the thunder was dreadful, "how great are the wondrous works of
the Creator! yea, even in the womb of the earth and the depths of the
waters!" And scarce had I said these words when one of these sylphs
appeared upon the waters and answered me, "Aha, and thou dost
acknowledge that before thou hast seen aught thereof: what wouldst say
if thou wert for once in the Centrum Terrae and beheldest our dwelling
which thy curiosity hath disturbed?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile there rose up here and there more of such water-spirits, like
diving birds, all looking upon me and bringing up again the stones I
had cast in, which amazed me much. And the first and chiefest among
them, whose raiment shone like pure gold and silver, cast to me a
shining stone of the bigness of a pigeon's egg and green and
transparent as an emerald, with these words: "Take thou this trinket,
that thou mayst have somewhat to report of us and of our lake." But
scarce had I picked it up and pocketed it when it seemed to me the air
would choke or drown me, so that I could not stand upright but rolled
about like a ball of yarn, and at last fell into the lake. Yet no
sooner was I in the water than I recovered, and through the virtue of
the stone I had upon me could breathe in water instead of air: yea,
I could with small effort float in the lake as well as could the
water-spirits, yea, and with them descended into the depths; which
reminded me of nothing so much as of a flock of birds that so descend
in circles from the upper air to light upon the ground.</p>

<p>But my dad having beheld this marvel in part (namely, so much of it as
was done above the water), made off from the lake and home again as if
his head were on fire. And there he told the whole history; but
especially how the water-spirits had brought back those stones that I
had cast into the lake, in the midst of the thunderstorm, and had laid
them where they came from, but in exchange had taken me down with them.
So some believed him but most accounted it a fable. Others conceived
that I had, like another Empedocles of Agrigentum (which cast himself
into Mount Aetna that all might think, since he was nowhere to be
found, that he was taken up to heaven), drowned myself in the lake, and
charged my father to spread such tales about me to gain for me an
immortal name: for, said they, it had long been marked by my
melancholic humour that I was half-desperate.</p>

<p>Others would fain have believed, had they not known my strength of
body, that my adopted father had himself murdered me to be rid of me
(being a miserly old man) and so be master alone on my farm: so that at
this time naught else but the Mummelsee and me and my departure and my
foster-father could be talked of or discoursed on either at the spa or
in the countryside.</p>
