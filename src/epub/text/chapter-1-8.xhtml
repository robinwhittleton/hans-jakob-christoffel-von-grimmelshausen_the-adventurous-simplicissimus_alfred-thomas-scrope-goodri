				<p epub:type="title">How Simplicissimus by His Noble Discourse Proclaimed His Excellent Qualities</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Hermit. What is thy name?</p>
			<p>Simplicissimus. My name is “Lad.”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> I can see well enough that thou art no girl: but how did thy father and mother call thee?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> I never had either father or mother.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Who gave thee then thy shirt?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Oho! Why, my mammy.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> What did thy mother call thee?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> She called me “Lad,” ay, and “rogue, silly gaby, and gallowsbird.”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Who, then, was thy mammy’s husband?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> No one.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> With whom, then, did thy mammy sleep at night?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> With my dad.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> What did thy dad call thee?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> He called me “Lad.”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> What was his name?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> His name was Dad.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> What did thy mammy call him?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Dad, and sometimes also “Master.”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Did she never call him aught besides?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Yea, that did she.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> And what then?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> “Beast,” “coarse brute,” “drunken pig,” and other the like, when she would scold him.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Thou beest but an ignorant creature, that knowest not thy parents’ name nor thine own.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Oho! neither dost thou know it.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Canst thou say thy prayers?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Nay, my mammy and our Ursel did uprear the beds.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> I ask thee not that, but whether thou knowest thy Paternoster?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> That do I.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Say it then.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Our father which art heaven, hallowed be name, to thy kingdom come, thy will come down on earth as it says heaven, give us debts as we give our debtors: lead us not into no temptation, but deliver us from the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> God help us! Knowest thou naught of our Blessed Lord God?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Yea, yea: ’tis he that stood by our chamber-door; my mammy brought him home from the church feast and stuck him up there.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> O Gracious God, now for the first time do I perceive what a great favour and benefit it is when Thou impartest knowledge of Thyself, and how naught a man is to whom Thou givest it not! O Lord, vouchsafe to me so to honour Thy holy name that I be worthy to be as zealous in my thanks for this great grace as Thou hast been liberal in the granting of it. Hark now, Simplicissimus (for I can call thee by no other name), when thou sayest thy Paternoster, thou must say this: “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven: give us this day our daily bread⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Oho there! ask for cheese too!</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Ah, dear child, keep silence and learn that thou needest more than cheese: thou art indeed loutish, as thy mammy told thee: ’tis not the part of lads like thee to interrupt an old man, but to be silent, to listen, and to learn. Did I but know where thy parents dwelt, I would fain bring thee to them, and then teach them how to bring up children.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> I know not whither to go. Our house is burnt, and my mammy ran off and was fetched back with our Ursula, and my dad too, and our maid was sick and lying in the stable.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> And who did burn the house?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Aha! there came iron men that sat on things as big as oxen, yet having no horns: which same men did slaughter sheep and cows and swine, and so I ran too, and then was the house burnt.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Where was thy dad then?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Aha! the iron men tied him up and our old goat was set to lick his feet. So he must needs laugh, and give the iron men many silver pennies, big and little, and fair yellow things and some that glittered, and fine strings full of little white balls.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> And when did this come to pass?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Why, even when I should have been keeping of sheep: yea, and they would even take from me my bagpipe.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> But when was it that thou shouldst have been keeping sheep?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> What, canst thou not hear? Even then when the iron men came: and then our Anna bade me run away, or the soldiers would carry me off: and by that she meant the iron men: so I ran off and so I came hither.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> And whither wilt thou now?</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Truly I know not: I will stay here with thee.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> Nay, to keep thee here is not to the purpose, either for me or thee. Eat now; and presently I will bring thee where people are.</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Oho! tell me now what manner of things be “people.”</p>
			<p><abbr class="eoc">H.</abbr> People be mankind like me and thee: thy dad, thy mammy, and your Ann be mankind, and when there be many together then are they called people: and now go thou and eat.</p>
			<p>So was our discourse, in which the hermit often gazed on me with deepest sighs: I know not whether ’twas so because he had great compassion on my simplicity and ignorance, or from that cause, which I learned not until some years later.</p>
